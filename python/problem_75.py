# Problem 75 (Singular Integer Right Triangles)
# =============================================
#
# It turns out that 12cm is the smallest length of wire that can be bent to
# form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but there
# are many more examples.
#
#   12cm: (3, 4, 5)
#   24cm: (6, 8, 10)
#   30cm: (5, 12, 13)
#   36cm: (9, 12, 15)
#   40cm: (8, 15, 17)
#   48cm: (12, 16, 20)
#
# In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20cm, cannot be bent to form an integer
# sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one solution to
# be found; for example, using 120cm it is possible to form exactly three
# different integer sided right angle triangles.
#
#   120cm: (30, 40, 50), (20, 48, 52), (24, 45, 51)
#
# Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of L â‰¤ 1_500_000
# can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?


# This seems like a straightforward search problem.
# Instead of checking all the combinations for every L,
# we can generate all small-enough Pythagorean triples, and check them.

# There is a nice way of generating all primitive Pythagorean triples:
# it uses a ternary tree, generates progressively larger triples, and
# each triple exactly once.
#
# ("Primitive" means that the 3 sides have no common multiple.)
#
# We get the non-primitive triples by scaling the primitive ones.
#
# The method is by B. Berggren (1934). For details, see:
