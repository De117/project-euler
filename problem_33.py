# Problem 33 (Digit cancelling fractions)
# =======================================
#
# The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician
# in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which
# is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
#
# We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
#
# There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less
# than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.
#
# If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms,
# find the value of the denominator.

# We're looking for fractions:
#  - without both numerator & denominator ending in same number (non-trivial)
#  - less than one (numerator < denominator)
#  - two digits in numerator and denominator (max. (99-9)Â² possibilities)
